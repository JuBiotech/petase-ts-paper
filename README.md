# Project for PETase secretion screening

The following runs were conducted:



| Run ID                | Enzyme | Purpose                              |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| BWA7DQ                | LCC    | TS Round 1.0                         |
| BWNZ99                | PE-H   | TS Round 1.0                         |
| BZACW9                | LCC    | TS Round 1.1                         |
| BZP1XQ                | PE-H   | TS Round 1.1                         |
| C3C1XZ                | LCC    | TS Round 2                           |
| C4PZHQ                | PE-H   | TS Round 2                           |
| CB4MNH                | PE-H   | Improved Assay Effect                |
| Fermentation_LipALipB | LCC    | Comparison to liter-scale bioreactor |
| Fermentation_YoaW     | LCC    | Comparison to liter-scale bioreactor |

Round 1 refers to the combined analysis of runs BWA7DQ & BZACW9 in case of LCC and BWNZ99 & BZP1XQ in case of PE-H.
The results for the combined analysis can be found in the folder BZACW9 and BZP1XQ doe LCC and PE-H respectively.

Run CB4MNH was conducted after experimental improvements with tip wetting to show that the previous bias in the columns of the assay MTP could be eradicated.

Raw data can be found in the ````data``` folder. Data analysis is conducted in ```data_analysis```. Plots for the accompanying paper can be found in ```paper```.
